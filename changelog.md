- Made the surveyBar sort by similar color, which is the only thing I set out to do
- Added *clearBar()*
- changed *fillBar()* to *tutdBar()*
- replaced *fillBar()* with *fillBar(color, stop, start)*, the fill parts of the bar with a chosen color
- Changed all settings to dictionaries for faster reference
- Changed settings to search for arguments in the settings dictionary automatically
- Added "captions" setting so that bar modes can operate without overwriting the text panel
